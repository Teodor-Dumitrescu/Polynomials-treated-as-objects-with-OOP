Implementation of Polynomials using OOP concepts.
A program based on treating polynomials as objects of base/derived classes.
It is my second project for the Object Orientet Programming course and it introduced me to new concepts like inheritance,
constructors and destructors and Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion :)
